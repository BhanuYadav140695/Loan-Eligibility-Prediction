# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

## Description:

The two most pressing issues in the banking sector are: 1) How risky is the borrower? 2) Should we lend to the borrower given the risk? The response to the first question dictates the borrower's interest rate. Interest rate, among other things (such as time value of money), tests the riskiness of the borrower, i.e. the higher the interest rate, the riskier the borrower. We will then decide whether the applicant is suitable for the loan based on the interest rate. Lenders (investors) make loans to creditors in return for the guarantee of interest-bearing repayment. That is, the lender only makes a return (interest) if the borrower repays the loan. However, whether he or she does not repay the loan, the lender loses money. Banks make loans to customers in exchange for the guarantee of repayment. Some would default on their debts, unable to repay them for a number of reasons. The bank retains insurance to minimize the possibility of failure in the case of a default. The insured sum can cover the whole loan amount or just a portion of it. Banking processes use manual procedures to determine whether or not a borrower is suitable for a loan based on results. Manual procedures were mostly effective, but they were insufficient when there were a large number of loan applications. At that time, making a decision would take a long time. As a result, the loan prediction machine learning model can be used to assess a customer's loan status and build strategies. This model extracts and introduces the essential features of a borrower that influence the customer's loan status. Finally, it produces the planned performance (loan status).

## Objective:

This Project is Develop for Banking System for checking the loan application eligibility.This Project is created to check the person that who applied for loan is eligible or Not.
